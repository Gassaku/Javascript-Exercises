Read through the script written at the bottom of the drumkit.html file
to see how a class has been created to handle the keydown window event.
When the event fires a CSS class is applied to selected Div elements
then removed once the transition of the CSS class ends.

Next, you need to create another class that also gets used by the window's
keydown event to select an 'audio' element based on the key pressed. The
selected audio element then needs to be played, which can easily be done
by using the .play() method on the selected element.

Make sure you create a new branch for your implementation and push it up
to the repository when you're finished. Then create a pull request so I can
review it and merge it into master if everything checks out!

Here's a working demo to see how the div animations work, https://codepen.io/rnice01/pen/bREzby
